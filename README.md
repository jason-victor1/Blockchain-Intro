## Bitcoin and Blockchain

- **Bitcoin**: First protocol utilizing blockchain technology.
- **Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto**: Peer-to-peer transactions within a decentralized network using cryptography.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Censorship-resistant finance.
  - Digital store of value (digital gold).
  - Fixed supply of Bitcoin, similar to gold.

### Core Design Principles of Bitcoin

The core design principles of Bitcoin are foundational to its success as a decentralized digital currency. These principles guide its functionality, security, and overall purpose. Here are the key design principles:

1. **Decentralization**
   - Bitcoin operates without a central authority, using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to validate and record transactions.
   - This decentralization ensures that no single entity can control or manipulate the network.

2. **Immutability**
   - Once recorded on the blockchain, transactions cannot be altered or deleted.
   - This is achieved through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW), which make tampering with data computationally prohibitive.

3. **Transparency**
   - Bitcoin's ledger is public and accessible to anyone, providing full transparency of all transactions.
   - This openness builds trust in the system and ensures accountability.

4. **Pseudonymity**
   - Users are identified by cryptographic addresses rather than personal information.
   - This offers a degree of privacy while maintaining traceability of transactions on the public ledger.

5. **Security**
   - Bitcoin relies on cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and wallets.
   - PoW mining ensures network security by requiring significant computational effort to validate new blocks.

6. **Scarcity**
   - Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, making it deflationary.
   - This scarcity is enforced through its protocol, mimicking the properties of gold and ensuring it serves as a store of value.

7. **Permissionless**
   - Anyone with internet access can participate in the Bitcoin network without needing permission from any central authority.
   - This inclusivity promotes financial freedom and accessibility.

8. **Censorship Resistance**
   - Bitcoin is designed to be resistant to censorship, meaning that no government, corporation, or individual can block or reverse transactions.
   - This is achieved through its decentralized and cryptographically secure architecture.

9. **Programmability**
   - While Bitcoin's scripting language is limited, it supports programmable functionality like multi-signature wallets and time-locked transactions.
   - This enhances its flexibility for certain use cases while prioritizing security.

10. **Open-Source**
    - Bitcoin's software is open-source, allowing anyone to review, audit, and contribute to its codebase.
    - This fosters trust, innovation, and community-driven development.

11. **Energy-Based Security Model**
    - PoW ties network security to energy expenditure, making attacks expensive and economically unfeasible.
    - This principle ensures the robustness of the network.

12. **Global Accessibility**
    - Bitcoin is designed to work across borders and is not tied to any particular government or currency.
    - This allows it to serve as a truly global currency.

These principles together create a resilient, secure, and widely adopted digital currency that has stood the test of time since its launch in 2009.

## Ethereum and Smart Contracts

- **Ethereum**: A decentralized platform founded by Vitalik Buterin and others, building on blockchain technology with extended capabilities.
- **Key Features**:
  - Decentralized transactions, organizations, and agreements through smart contracts.
  - Turing-complete smart contracts, enabling complex programmability compared to Bitcoin’s Turing-incomplete contracts.
- **Historical Insight**:
  - Based on Nick Szabo's 1994 concept of smart contracts: self-executing agreements without intermediaries.

### Core Design Principles of Ethereum

Ethereum is designed as a versatile, decentralized platform for building applications and smart contracts. Its core design principles reflect its aim to extend blockchain capabilities beyond Bitcoin’s financial transactions. Here are the key principles:

1. **Decentralization**
   - Ethereum operates on a global, peer-to-peer network without a central authority.
   - Consensus mechanisms, initially Proof-of-Work (PoW) and now Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after the Merge, ensure distributed control and integrity.

2. **Programmability**
   - Ethereum introduces a Turing-complete virtual machine (the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM), enabling developers to write and execute complex smart contracts.
   - This allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can automate and execute agreements.

3. **Smart Contracts**
   - Smart contracts are self-executing code that runs on the blockchain, enforcing agreements without intermediaries.
   - This principle allows Ethereum to support a variety of use cases, from DeFi and NFTs to supply chain management and gaming.

4. **Universal Computation**
   - Ethereum acts as a global decentralized computer, where anyone can deploy or interact with dApps.
   - Its state is maintained across all nodes, ensuring consistency and reliability.

5. **Transparency**
   - All transactions and smart contracts are stored on a public ledger.
   - This openness promotes trust and auditability while allowing participants to verify activity on the network.

6. **Censorship Resistance**
   - Transactions and applications on Ethereum cannot be censored or tampered with due to its decentralized structure and cryptographic security.

7. **Permissionless Access**
   - Anyone with internet access can interact with Ethereum’s network, deploy smart contracts, or participate as a validator.
   - This inclusivity democratizes access to technology and financial tools.

8. **Tokenization and Fungibility**
   - Ethereum supports creating fungible tokens (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC-721/1155).
   - This flexibility has enabled innovations like stablecoins, NFTs, and digital asset ecosystems.

9. **Upgradability**
   - Ethereum is designed to evolve, with a robust community and governance structure enabling protocol upgrades.
   - Examples include transitioning from PoW to PoS and introducing scaling solutions like rollups.

10. **Interoperability**
    - Ethereum aims to be compatible with other blockchains through standards like ERC-20 and cross-chain bridges.
    - This enhances its ability to integrate with the broader decentralized ecosystem.

11. **Economic Incentives**
    - Ether (ETH) serves as a native cryptocurrency and utility token for transaction fees, staking, and economic alignment.
    - Mechanisms like gas fees and staking rewards incentivize participants to secure and maintain the network.

12. **Security**
    - Ethereum prioritizes cryptographic security to ensure the safety of transactions, smart contracts, and user funds.
    - The shift to PoS strengthens security while reducing energy consumption.

13. **Energy Efficiency**
    - Post-Merge Ethereum reduces its environmental footprint significantly, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability.

14. **Global Accessibility**
    - Ethereum is designed as a neutral, borderless platform.
    - It provides services for diverse industries, regardless of location or governance systems.

15. **Scalability and Layer 2 Solutions**
    - Ethereum’s architecture encourages scalability through solutions like rollups, sharding, and sidechains.
    - These reduce congestion and improve transaction speeds while maintaining decentralization.

16. **Open-Source**
    - Ethereum is open-source, fostering innovation and collaboration within the global developer community.

These principles enable Ethereum to serve as a robust platform for decentralized applications. It extends blockchain functionality far beyond cryptocurrency into realms like finance, gaming, governance, and identity.

## The Oracle Problem

- Smart contracts' limitation: Cannot access real-world data directly.
- Oracles: Provide external data and computation to blockchains.
- Decentralized Oracle Networks: Necessary to maintain decentralization.
- Hybrid Smart Contracts: Combine on-chain logic with off-chain data.

## Chainlink

- Decentralized Oracle network.
- Enables smart contracts to access external data and computation.
- Blockchain agnostic: Works with any blockchain.

## Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

- Addressing blockchain scaling issues.
- Layer 2 (L2) solutions: Other blockchains hook into the main blockchain to scale.
- Two primary types:
  - **Optimistic Rollups**: e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum.
  - **Zero-Knowledge Rollups**: e.g., ZK Sync, Polygon ZK EVM.

## Terminology
