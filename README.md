## Bitcoin and Blockchain

- Bitcoin: First protocol utilizing blockchain technology.
- Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto: Peer-to-peer transactions within a decentralized network using cryptography.
- Key Concepts:
  - Censorship-resistant finance.
  - Digital store of value (digital gold).
  - Fixed supply of Bitcoin, similar to gold.

## Ethereum and Smart Contracts

- Founded by Vitalik Buterin and others.
- Builds on blockchain infrastructure with additional capabilities.
- Decentralized transactions, organizations, and agreements through smart contracts.
- Nick Szabo's concept (1994): Smart contracts executed in a decentralized way without intermediaries.
- Key Difference: Ethereum's Turing-complete smart contracts vs. Bitcoin's Turing-incomplete contracts.

## The Oracle Problem

- Smart contracts' limitation: Cannot access real-world data directly.
- Oracles: Provide external data and computation to blockchains.
- Decentralized Oracle Networks: Necessary to maintain decentralization.
- Hybrid Smart Contracts: Combine on-chain logic with off-chain data.

## Chainlink

- Decentralized Oracle network.
- Enables smart contracts to access external data and computation.
- Blockchain agnostic: Works with any blockchain.

## Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

- Addressing blockchain scaling issues.
- Layer 2 (L2) solutions: Other blockchains hook into the main blockchain to scale.
- Two primary types:
  - **Optimistic Rollups**: e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum.
  - **Zero-Knowledge Rollups**: e.g., ZK Sync, Polygon ZK EVM.

## Terminology

### Common Terms

- **Web3**: New paradigm of the internet powered by blockchain and smart contracts.
  - **Web1**: Permissionless open sources web with static content.
  - **Web2**: Permissioned web with dynamic content run by companies.
  - **Web3**: Permissionless web with dynamic content. Decentralized, censorship-resistant networks. User-owned ecosystems where individuals own a portion of the protocols they engage in.

## Conclusion

- Provides a foundational understanding of Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum, smart contracts, and related technologies.
